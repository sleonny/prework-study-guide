# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The reason behind creating this webpage was to practice the fundamentals of languages and concepts we will use in bootcamp.  In building it I was able to use HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript to add different features and learn how each language impacted what we see and use online.  This page is also a handy repository for notes I've taken while progressing through the prework.  I learned the fundamentals of these 4 languages/concepts and think I have a solid base to improve on down the road.
